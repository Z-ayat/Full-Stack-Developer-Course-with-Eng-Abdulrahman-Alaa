    <p>A dashboard is a type of graphical user interface which often provides at-a-glance views of key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to a particular objective or business process. In other usage, "dashboard" is another name for "progress report"
        or "report" and considered a form of data visualization. In providing this overview, business owners can save time and improve their decision making by utilizing dashboards.[1] The “dashboard” is often accessible by a web browser and is usually
        linked to regularly updating data sources. Well known dashboards include Google Analytics dashboards, used on 55% of all websites,[2] which show activity on a website; such as visits, entry pages, bounce rate and traffic sources. The COVID-19
        pandemic of 2020 brought other dashboards to the fore, with the Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker[3] and the UK government coronavirus tracker[4] being good examples. The term dashboard originates from the automobile dashboard where drivers monitor
        the major functions at a glance via the instrument panel.Digital dashboards allow managers to monitor the contribution of the various departments in their organization. In addition, they enable “rolling up” of information to present a consolidated
        view across an organization. To gauge exactly how well an organization is performing overall, digital dashboards allow you to capture and report specific data points from each department within the organization, thus providing a "snapshot" of
        performance.
